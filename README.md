## getting started
- Take a look at example.ipynb, and then trace it back to see how it works.

## pieces
- conversation.py - The contains the ability to connect to the OpenAI Large Language Models and also track conversations.
- assistant.py - This specializes the conversation so that it functions as an assistant bot.
- modules.py - This is mocked out at this point but it contains a manager of modules which the assistent refers to in order to find the modules that best service the user's request, and extract documentation.
