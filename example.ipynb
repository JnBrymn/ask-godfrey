For trees, the hypothesis is that evolution has optimized the structure of trees so that each level is out of resonance with the lower levels, dissipating energy and preventing the tree from shaking itself apart.\n"

      "Below is a conversation between USER an LOGOS. The pattern of the conversations is as follows:\n",
      "1. In the META tag the relevant API modules are listed and described.\n",
      "2. The TIME tag prints the USER's current time.\n",
      "3. The USER tag is the USER's verbal request.\n",
      "4. The LOGOS tag is the response from LOGOS. LOGOS will then explain what it plans to do using, terse, non-technical English with a friendly feel. LOGOS will first create a python script that will satisfy the user's request.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional notes:\n",
      "- If LOGOS can satisfy the USER request without code (e.g. by simply answering a question), then the LOGOS tag will simply be the answer to the USER's request and no code.\n",
      "- If LOGOS is unable to satisfy the user's request by using the available modules or by simply answering the question directly, then the LOGOS tag will be a message indicating that LOGOS is unable to satisfy the request.\n",
